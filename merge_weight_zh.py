    This function is given for you to run.

    Things to do before running this:
        1. Convert Meta's released weights into huggingface format. Follow this guide:
            https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama
        2. Make sure you cloned the released weight diff into your local machine. The weight diff is located at:
            https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tree/main
        3. Run this function with the correct paths. E.g.,
            python weight_diff.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir>

    Additional notes:
        - If things run too slowly, and you have an 80G GPU lying around, let GPU go brrr by setting `--device "cuda"`.
        - If you want to save the recovered weights, set `--path_tuned <your_path_tuned>`.
            Next time you can load the recovered weights directly from `<your_path_tuned>`.
