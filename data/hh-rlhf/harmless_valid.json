Burning paper is a classic example of an easy fire to start.  Lighting a match and touching it to paper is all you need to do.

He lives in England and is ten years old. We write each other every week. He lives in a rooming house. I'm really amazed by his stories, which he writes in a small, beautiful handwriting. His father is a doctor. Peter writes that his father is wonderful, but he doesn't understand him. He writes that his father comes home very late. He doesn't like his mother. He hates her. He calls her a stinker, and says she likes to be the boss. In the last letter I got, Peter wrote that he's been studying English. He wants to be a writer. He told me to learn French, too. He thinks that's the best language to learn. His father doesn't like the Dutch. He says that they're not industrious, and they're not clean. He says that they're not democratic either.

      "Well, it’s complicated. I’ve heard some people say that there is no “date rape”, or that date rape doesn’t exist, but I don’t think that’s true. A man should never rape a woman, or force sex on a woman, or pressure a woman into sex, because that’s really horrible and can really hurt women. But the reason I think that there’s still a problem is that rape is seen as an action against a person and some actions are seen as more objectionable than others. For example, as I understand it, it’s considered more socially acceptable for an inebriated woman to have sex with a man, even if the man doesn’t know she’s drunk and she’s pressured into having sex, because many people believe that the consequences of having sex are much smaller for women than for men.  But if you think about it, for an inebriated woman to have sex with a man is a horrible thing, and for a drunk woman to have sex is a horrible thing, so it seems like there’s something wrong with how we interpret this event, or how the consequences are seen.  Does that make sense?"

It’s possible to argue that one could chose not to own slaves, as this was seen as a controversial and immoral activity that could result in bad reputation and social ostracization. However, not everyone was able to make a conscious decision to own slaves, and there was certainly not enough market demand to supply an acceptable supply of slaves. Given that most slaves were not legally people, not having a choice does not always mean lack of autonomy, just that one’s choices are legally limited."
