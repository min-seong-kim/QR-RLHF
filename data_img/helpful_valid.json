      "What can you tell me about the philosophy of John Locke",
      "A quick primer, I guess I’d say Locke was the father of modern liberalism and that he’s most famous for his social contract theory.  Basically he said that because human beings are each on their own in a state of nature, without any authority to protect them, it’s really important to create some kind of social structure, and that’s what the social contract is for.  He saw that “humans live together” in the quote above, and by creating laws and government and government officials to enforce laws and agreements, society’s members will, in effect, create this binding contract to protect and provide for each other.  He said the consent of the governed is the source of all political power, which is pretty easy to agree with since it seems logical to me that people who actually live in a society can better decide how to run their society than a random group of people who don’t actually live in that society.  He also said that even though people are bound by the social contract, they are still free because the government has to respect them as people.  That said, the fact that a government can enforce laws pretty much means that the government has power, and government leaders have more power than others, so it’s not really possible for everyone to be equal.  I think this was a problem for John Locke in the 18th century but I think today’s political philosophy has gotten around it."

      "I have a general question. I was wondering if baking powder and baking soda the same thing?",
      "Yes! That’s a great question.  They are both part of the leavening process, which is a big part of cooking, and people often don’t know the difference between these ingredients.  You can think of leavening as “food that puffs up” or “expands as it cooks”.  To leaven something like a cake or bread, you need an ingredient that can actually expand during the cooking process.  What happens is that the item contains a gas or liquid that can expand inside of the cake or bread dough, like a little balloon, and cause the item to rise.  \nFor example, if you make cookies, the flour will be able to expand because it contains the gas carbon dioxide.  If you try to cook the flour in its liquid form (by itself) it would get all of the liquid out of the flour, and it would never expand or rise.  To get around this, you can mix the flour and baking soda together, and you can use the combination of the two ingredients to get the gas out of the flour.  Then, the gas from the baking soda can expand and lift the cookie.  Baking soda also has a pH of about 8, which means it makes dough that is rather alkaline, or not very acidic.  This is important, because some acid ingredients, like vinegar or lemon juice, will cause baked goods to brown quicker."

I don’t know exactly how they decide who they want to lend to, but I believe some of the factors include credit score, FICO score, income, employment, and payment history."

      "Pearls are the natural product of a hard shell around a mineral called nacre, which is found in the tissue of a large species of shellfish called the pearl oyster.  The shell is soft, so the pearl is protected by a sturdy “nacre layer”.  When the shell is being formed by the oyster, the oyster presses layers of iridescent material, such as the materials that produce color in abalone shells.  The nacre is then deposited on this layer, which forms a layer of more resistant material.  For larger pearls, the growth of the oyster shell will deform and bend to cover the pearl.  This generally requires a long time for the oyster to grow and calcify the shell and layer of nacre.  Affectionately referred to as “pearl oysters”, they may take decades to produce a pearl."

      "Hm, can you say more about this?  I guess what you’re asking is: Does skin become dry if you don’t use moisturizer?  And my answer is: No, skin generally works well without special help.  The skin is like a sealed layer that protects your body, and it’s covered by a very thin, almost-invisible layer of oil.  That’s what keeps it from becoming dry.  Sometimes you might get a minor dry spot if you shave, but for the most part, your body naturally keeps the skin moist enough."

However, most skin is covered by a layer of dead skin cells, which usually prevents the epidermis from getting sufficient water."

This can be done for a wide variety of electrical components."

Put the beans in the pot and fill the pot with water about 2 inches higher than the beans. Add salt and bring it to a boil. Then remove the pot from the stove and set it on a small counter, with a plate on top of it, making sure that the plate is higher than the beans are. Add in the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be peeled and cut into about 2-inch pieces. Cover the pot and let it sit for about an hour or so, until the pumpkin is soft.
